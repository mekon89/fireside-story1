    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
      and there was no one around.  Until suddenly...
      Mike went crazy and threw his computer at the wall, 
      because github was speaking Japanesse and kept lying to him about what to do.
      It finally happened.  After months of planning and preparation, LaunchCode had embeded the right commands to break him.  
      One point for LaunchCode...but will Mike make a come back?
