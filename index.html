  <h1> The Best Story Ever!</h1>
<body>
    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
      and there was no one around.  Until suddenly...
      Mike went crazy and threw his computer at the wall, 
      because github was speaking Japanesse and kept lying to him about what to do.
      It finally happened.  After months of planning and preparation, 
      LaunchCode had embeded the right commands to break him.  
      One point for LaunchCode...but will Mike make a come back?
      Yes, yes he will. But first, he braved the rain in cold to buy a dragon. Why, you ask? 
      Because he wanted a dragon in the story.
      This dragon not only held the fire-breathing awesomeness dragons are known for, 
      but was also a loyal side kick to help take down and defeat the ever present LaunchCode prep work.
